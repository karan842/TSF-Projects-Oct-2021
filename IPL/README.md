# EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS - IPL

## Indian Premier League aka IPL is the biggest cricket league in the world.

From the given IPL Data our task is to analyze and visualize, here we have two datasets which contanins data of Matches since 2008 to 2020 and Ball By Ball data from 2008 to 2020 respectively.
Firstly, I collected the data from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/patrickb1912/ipl-complete-dataset-20082020) and divided this data into two dataframes those are Matches and Ball by Ball.
Data Cleaning, Data Analysis, visualization from graphs and charts are peroformed in this notebook.
