# K-Means Clustering of Classic IRIS Dataset

## I hope you are familiar with IRIS dataset, so our task is to predict class and find clusters points to plot, from this data

**I used here the classic machine learning apporach to complete this task and with the help of K-Means Clustering Machine Learning Algorithm to make clusters of output and plot them**

## Thank You!
